#summary How to configure Procurement to only update the leagues you want

= Introduction =

Procurement v0.0.8 has introduced the ability to set which leagues to update when logging in, for situations where you have a high number of stash tabs, and do not want to update them for every league, every time you login.

= Details =

   * Open settings.xml in the Procurement folder
   * Edit the following line(Note if you're using an old setting file, you can add this manually under the UserSettings section): 

   {{{
        <Setting name="DownloadOnlyMyLeagues" value="false" />
   }}}

   * And set DownloadOnlyMyLeagues to true:

   {{{
        <Setting name="DownloadOnlyMyLeagues" value="true" />
   }}}
   
   * Next, remove leagues you *do not* want to update on login from the MyLeagues section, leaving *only* the leagues you do want updated. For example, if you only want to update Anarchy and Onslaught, MyLeagues should look like this:

   {{{
        <List name="MyLeagues">
            <Item value="Onslaught"/>
            <Item value="Anarchy"/>
        </List>
   }}}

   * Finally save the settings file and run Procurement, it will now only update the leagues you have selected
