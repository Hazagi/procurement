This page will cover how to use and configure the buyout system introduced in Procurement 1.1.0

= Setting Buyouts =

To set a buyout on an item, simply right click the item, you will be presented with a context menu:

Simply enter in the amount, or use the +/- buttons to increase or decrease the amount, and select the orb type, by default chaos is used.

To save the buyout, simply click "Save Buyout", the buyout will be saved without any need to restart Procurement


= Configuring how buyouts are displayed =

Procurement 1.1.0 has introduced two new settings:

{{{
    <Setting name="EmbedBuyouts" value="True" />
    <Setting name="BuyoutItemsOnlyVisibleInBuyoutsTag" value="False" />
}}}

The EmbedBuyouts setting will add the buyout for an item inside existing tags/categorys. For example, if you have a great tri res rare chest piece, and you set a 1ex buyout, the buyout will display inside your {TriRes} section as well as {RareChest}. You will no longer need to use the {Buyout} tag (but you still can if you want to!) By default, this setting is enabled.

The long named BuyoutItemsOnlyVisibleInBuyoutsTag setting will make buyouts only display in the {Buyouts} section, and not in the rest of your tags/sections. By default, this setting is disabled.
